attnlruter it to the tenth century3 hut there he ie undoubtedly wrong.
'shut Bentley knew the Mu, wur very probable, since he neu ‘Library

therefore, no doubt thet Bentley means our MS. when, speaking in hir

in the proeent edition ir 241, but which in the MSS„ stando after r. 390
(=118, 23), ho seya·‘Proper-e e pluribus codd obest, ut a Regio 800
annerum Lego: Nimirum occidor, ni iutro huc propero cirrere' The
word in question ir actually omitted in J (a fact of which we cheli heve
torpeulr prmeutly) and thero neitherir nor war any other MS. of Pluutua
