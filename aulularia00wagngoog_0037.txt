Andronicus, Naevius and Ennius (Aura 118. 481819. 433. 306 od.
laidet), aud in a hexameter in the sepulchral inscription whieh
Plautus is said to have eomposod ior himself :

seatnast deserte: dein llisns Ludus locamus.

It is therefore by no means surprising to lind that Plautus uses tha

abente dozen passages by Weise', but it was again rejected by Ritsehl.

The ending or in nonna oi tlre third deelension is frequently long.
