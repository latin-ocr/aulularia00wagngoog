, In the Introduction I have chictly endeavoured to
gire a brief, but clear and sufficient summary of the lnws
l of Plautian prosody. . This seemcd the moro necessary as
2th0 results of the investigations of Ilitschl and other
German scholars on this subjectare either totallyunknown
or, at the best, but partially known in this country, and
are moreover not easily accessihle to the English stu· Ι
’ dent, they being scattered through Ritsohl's Plautus aud
i prooemia, and many volumes of Gcnnnn philological
{personas ,
ζ 2 In concluding this preface it gives mc great pleasure
J {publicly to ackuowledgc the manifold obligations which
ι y Ι owe to Dr. Ernest Adams, who has not only kindly
ε ytouohcd my English style in many a soro part bnt to
l ί whose hints and suggestions both the Introduction and
l notes are greatly indebted.

l Ι Thns Ι dismiss my boolr, though I feel that it stands
¹ , in need of much indulgence and forbearance-1 venture
{to say that it would be better if I could have written
², stt at a place more favourable to philological studies
l 'than Manchester.
