xlviii irraonuurror.

The two genitires eiua sud laius are oeeasionelly shortened in their
first syllable, when standing ester a short acoeuted syllable¹s

ιιι sthi eins insist edpisrn· ills enim sd negat
Ter. Pham. ι 2, tt.

si quid hidas simile ldrte aliquando eudnerit
Ter. liant. tim. us 2. 20. . ·

hlr Purry gives in the first instance eidi at eiua, while he preserves
the reading oi the MSS. in the second passage, where it would have
been just ss saepto transpose si huius quid. But thereis no note on
either passage ιο eulighten the render about sacha surprising incon·
sistency.

Το this shortemd quantity in the genitive we may add an instnnee
in which the dstiro daie has the metriord ralne of a short syllable: Ter.
Aa ιν 5, 4 (=o³srl):

qaid huie laio negotist? time has pepulisti loris?

This is, as sar as I ean see, the reading oi all MSS. sud editione, bnt
no editor has a note on the shortened quantity oi Ιιιιὶσ. Guyet alone
(somna p. 244) proposes to write quid laic daie.

The word αιιι appears ιι1ιοιιοιιοι1 Bacch 491, where Fleckeisen gives
in accordance with all the MSS. as follows:

sitin ut quem tu hsheis fidelem tihi siit quoi eredas rit-scissi

Rinchl admits s hiatus, omits tu and transposes tibifidelem

Eren tho shonmring oi the first syllable in audini would have to be
assumed, it the reading of a line in the Truesdeutus (ι 2, 92:126 G.)
were ssl'ely established. Ia this passage the MSS, give

peperisse tam sedni :z ah. obsecra tsoe Diniarehs τι quid isin

Bnt, secording to Geppert's testimony, the old Ambrosisn palim- ’
psest omits eniri, so that the line would bo unobjectionsble. Itis, how·
eser, not impossible that tho omission οι ears is dne ιο the metriesl
correction oi some ancient grammarian whose authority wss followed by
the scribe ottho MS.

2. We shall now mention some instnnees where the ususl eules oi
peritton here to yield to the rhythmical inssnence οι the necent Thus
