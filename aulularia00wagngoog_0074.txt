Tho theory that tho nutuml necent of the Latin was, in tho earliest
period of Latin poetry, un important luctor in versificatiou, which
decided its whole ehuurcter, was first established hy Bentley in his
‘schediasma' Nerertlreless, Bentley could not establish this theory
without ullos-ing n dill'erenco between natural und -nnetricnl necent in
the first und lust dipodies, because without ehfs liberty it would hare
been n mero irnpossihility to transfor Greek metros und remifiention
into the Latin lunguuge. Bentley hed, of course, to correct u great
mnuy persegne in Terence which were against iris theory, and correct
them hc did nudnuntedly. llis theory was adopted by G. Hermann
(el. el. ns ln ill), though with tho udnrissiou that tbc noeis to whom it
applied, did not seem to follow it consistently ς und the sume theory is
the grouudwork of Ritsehl's riews ns dereloped in the xl· und xrr
chayters of tho Prolcyorueuu. 1 n tho versification of the eornie writers,
Ritselrl discovers n struggle between u merely qrmntitntire metrienl
gecentrrutiou und tho reul necent of every-day life. According to his

theory, the natural necent of the lnuguuge still exereised great inflnoneo

upon tho versification of Plautus und lris conteruymrsu'cs, while it was
entirely dismgurded in the Augustun period, when n merely quantitutiro

. system of ressiticution became dominnnt.

An uectrmto examinution of this theory is due to tho joint lebours
of Franz Rittcr, Α. Bhelrlr, weil und Benlocw, and Corssen.

As no theory aruils us nuytlring, unless it bo confirmed by nn·
doubted fnets‚ it will hc nseful to consider the following proportione
which we borrow from Coresen This scholar hus eomputed the average

number of passages in which metricnl und naturul necent differ, for the
following poete: .
