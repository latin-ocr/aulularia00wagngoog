iromB with regard to the distrrhution os the versosz a g. v. 88. 186
ete Sometimes worda are omitted rrhieh we find ia B, ag. r. 78.
, 110 (where ris is substituted sor si quid uie) 166. 211 eta, some·
timos again we dud the reverse, that J hanone or two words more than
B, ag. v. 44„ 55. 227. 340 eta These passages (to which we might
easily add others oi therama description) suffiae to prore that J
actually ia the souros ol many ol the late MSS. os the first eight oomo-
(hes, since ln every one oi them the reading osJ is found in either
all or st least several recent MSS. We need, therefore, not presup
pose a MS. ζ aa their source3 sor even isJ itsels was not their
actual source, they would have to he derived from a MS. os exactly
the same description.
