with long and heavy vowelo. Some ol these arehaie long vowelr are
oooaeionally found eren in lator writers, hut a great many os them
appear still in Plautus and his contemporaries. They are, however, of
mre occurrenoe in Terence, noy, some os them eoem to have been
entirely lost in the period between Plautus and Terence. In the sol·

Plantae: but before undertaking their pomoni, the render must be ἶ,
