corrected copy of a very faulty archetype. Whether this presumptioni
bo true or not, we shall soen have ιο decide.

The last page of tho MS. u filled with an extract en the critical
signs used by the ancient gntmmarisns taken from Isidor (Oi-ig. 1 20)¹‚
'but without any indication of ita source It is written in the nme
handwriting as the preceding Plautian comedics.

Before euteriug into a detailcd discussion of the critical rulue of
this MS„ 1 liare ιο says few words as ιο its general orthography'.
Generallp speaking, it is much inferior ιο Β in thie respect: almost dl
theold spellings wc find iu B, are modernised in J. Our commentam
will show that such forms as tlmenrm adolescens edumas arripio
surripui surreptum cum etc. are much more frequent in Jthsu fleat·
saurus ededcaceaa etc as found in Β. Neverthelcss, not s few traces of
older aud better spellings are lou, e g. aptet optigit opturet (302) corson
etc 1 may coufidently state that 1 have tried ιο be monteful ιι
possible with regard ιο these rrtirrutiee, aud 1 hope alus nothing hus
escaped my eyes, the MS. having boen collatcd by mpself twice eyes·
and inspcctcd agurio uberet-er a doubt arose But there is one point in ’
which this MS. differs essentially froin B: vir. its treatment of encliticc
nnd procle'tlcs. Iprcsume that this ie e point very often neglected by
manuscriptcolletors, although it meme ιο have a just claim upon our
attention, as being nn undoubted relic of antiquity which wc ought ιο

notice, ifuot ιο preserve. Ritschl lias s few lines about it, Prott Prin.-
cxn, where he mentions

apee=ah ee, 'Prin 79.
apatirpc=ab stirpe, ibid 21⁷.

both found iu B I may edd that it is not difficult ιο collect mmyother
instauecs of such spellings from Ritschl’s critical continentur), eg.

‘opsnatu ιι, Perse 60 (B)

allemand laeuam, Glor. 301 (B)

appatrem=ed patrem, Mero. 962 (0)

espencaeus=sub arianus, Pers. 4⁵0 (BCD ‘qued obscum
notui· Rinchl)
