the critical notes, but surely many studente will desire
have explanatory notos, without which the edition wou

language, Ι have written my notes in English, though
am well auare that in so doingI must rely on the f·
bcarancc aud kiuduess of my readers, who will, Ι ho
not be very strict in the case of a foreigner whose ι
quaintance with the English language is of no very lo
standing. Imay say that I have read aud studied 1
the corrrmentarics ever written on the Aululariam
thero scarcely can be anything of importanoe iu the
which would not be found in my notos. But et the sa·
time, Ι have tried to avoid all- unneecssary aud sup
fluous crudition which secmed to have no connexion wi
the explanation of the text. On thewhole Ι venture
hope that a student will aster the porusal of my no
be sufficiently prepared for a critical study of the Plauti
corucdies. 1 have not thought my commentary to be
place whcrciu to mention the names efformet comm
tators wheueverI am iudcbted to them for explanatio
or quotations; there is indeed a great deal ofexegeti
matter running through all commentarios, and well-huo
to every scholar3 special mention has, however, ιι
thought necessary in exceptional cases where pec ⁰
honour securcd duc to tho discovery of difficolt erpla

and illustratione given in the present commentary ·
be thought an improvement or not, I must leave
